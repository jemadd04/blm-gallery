## Black Lives Matter Image Gallery

With the current climate of what's going on in the world, I wanted to create a project that reflected some of the powerful images pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement. The tech I used for this project includes:
* React
* Axios
* React Infinite Scroll
* Styled Components
* Unsplash API
* CSS Grid

Hosted on Netlify and can be viewed <a href="https://5edfb99179892505b6288f93--blm-photo-gallery.netlify.app/">here</a>!
